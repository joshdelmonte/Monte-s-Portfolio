# Monte-s-Portfolio
# Description

    -The motivation of this portfolio is to demonstrate a portion of my skills concerning advanced CSS, and to allow access to links that may interest future
    employers

   - I've created this to be a repository for me to add contact info and previous works through the display and interactive layout.

    -The intent of this page allows brief view of my previous projects and apporpriate links to my Facebook, LinkedIn, and Github profiles. I intend to 
    add my resume and eventually companies I've worked for.

    -I've learned tons of customization through advanced CSS, modifying various items on my page, and only cracked the surface of what would be interesting to 
    potential employers.
